                <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                <p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. Despite initial struggles in school, his
                    curiosity for mathematics and physics flourished during his youth. He studied at the Swiss Federal
                    Polytechnic School in Zurich, where he honed his scientific skills.</p>

                <h2>Major Contributions</h2>
                <p>Einstein's most celebrated work includes the Theory of Relativity, encapsulated in the equation
                    <strong>E=mcÂ²</strong>. This theory revolutionized the understanding of time, space, and energy. His
                    contributions also extended to quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, significantly advancing
                    20th-century science.</p>

                <h2>Academic and Professional Career</h2>
                <p>Einstein worked as a patent examiner before securing positions in academia. He taught at prestigious
                    institutions such as the University of Berlin and Princeton University, where he was affiliated
                    with the Institute for Advanced Study.</p>

                <h2>Impact on Science and Society</h2>
                <p>Beyond physics, Einstein was an advocate for civil rights, global peace, and scientific integrity. He
                    was a vocal opponent of war and played a significant role in advocating for the establishment of
                    Israel as a Jewish homeland.</p>

                <h2>Awards and Recognition</h2>
                <p>Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric
                    effect, a cornerstone of quantum theory. He received numerous other honors during his lifetime,
                    solidifying his legacy as a scientific luminary.</p>

                <h2>Famous Quotes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Imagination is more important than knowledge."</li>
                    <li>"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving."</li>
                    <li>"Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new."</li>
                    <li>"Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better."</li>
                    <li>"The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination."</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Einstein's work laid the foundation for modern physics and transformed the way humanity perceives the
                    universe. His theories continue to inspire scientific research and technological advancements.</p>
